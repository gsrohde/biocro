# Introduction {-}

The documentation in this short book is aimed at developersâ€”at those
who will be writing new modules or modifying existing ones; and most
especially at those fixing bugs in or adding new features to the
BioCro simulation framework, and those involved with the overall
maintenance of the BioCro package.
