## This file gives some ideas of some settings you might want to
## customize.  To customize the default Doxygen settings specified in
## doxygen/Doxyfile, copy this file to a file named Doxyfile (in this
## directory), and then modify it as needed.  (Or simply create
## doxygen/customizations/Doxyfile from scratch!)

## Possible settings


## If you are working on Doxygen comments in one particular file, you
## may want to be able to generate the resulting documentation
## quickly.  One way to do this is to override the INPUT configuration
## variable to point to the one file you are working on.  So as not to
## overwrite previously-generated "complete" documentation, you may
## want to set OUTPUT_DIRECTORY as well.  (Note: the Make-file recipes
## currently ignore these overrides, so you must use doxygen or
## doxywizard directly for them to take effect.)

INPUT            = "../src/module_library/thermal_time_senescence.hpp"
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "customized_docs"


## To create the inheritance and dependency graphs in the Doxygen
## documentation, Doxygen must know how to find the dot tool.  This
## can be done either by ensuring the directory containing it is on
## the executable search path or by setting the Doxygen configuration
## variable DOT_PATH.  Here is a possible setting for DOT_PATH that
## might be used by a Windows user:

DOT_PATH               = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin"


## If you want to speed up Doxygen compilation by not bothering to
## generate call graphs, inheritance graphs, and inclusion graphs (or
## if you really don't have the dot tool!), use this setting:
HAVE_DOT = NO


## If you wanted to generate the PDF documentation and not generate
## the HTML documentation, you could use these settings:
GENERATE_LATEX = YES
GENERATE_HTML  = NO


## If you want colors that will keep you awake:
HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE    = 5
HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 255
HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA  = 240


## If you don't want to document private class members:
EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = NO
